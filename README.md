#WEEK 1

  ➤ Orientation about the course DISMATH (Discrete Mathematics)
  
  ➤ Introduction of some applications of Dismath in certain word problems
  
      E.g. Knights and Knaves
 
  ➤ Introduction to Logical Operations

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive Disjunction | xor |  p ⊕ q |
| → | Conditional | if, then | p → q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | p ↔ q |
  
  ➤ The truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Disjunction, Conditional, Biconditional (T & F) or (1 & 0)
  
| p | q | p ∧ q | p v q | p ⊕ q | p → q | p ↔ q |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------:|
| F | F | F | F | F | T | T |
| F | T | F | T | T | T | F |
| T | F | F | T | T | F | F |
| T | T | T | T | F | T | T |

  ➤ Propositional Logic: (p → q)
  
    ∙ is the area of logic dealing with propositions.
  
       ✓ Inverse: ¬p → ¬q
  
       ✓ Converse: q → p
  
       ✓ Contraposition: ¬q → ¬p

    ∙ Distributive Law
        
        ✓ p v (q v r) ≡ (p v q) v (p v r)
        
        ✓ p ∧ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∧ (p ∧ r) 
        
    ∙ De Morgan's Law
        
        ✓ ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q
        
        ✓ ¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q

    ∙ Resolution

#WEEK 3

  ➤ Introduction to Methods of Proof
    
    ∙ Direct Proof:
    
       First Step: Assume that "p" is TRUE
    
       Second Step: Show that "q" is also TRUE

    ∙ Indirect Proof:
    
        First Step: Assume that "¬q" is TRUE
        
        Second Step: Show that "¬p" is also TRUE
        
    ∙ Proof by Contradiction:
        
        First Step: Assume that the "antecedent" is FALSE
        
        Second Step: Using an assumption and other facts show that it is a contradiction
        
    ∙ Proof by Contraposition:
    
        First Step: Assume that the "premise" is FALSE
        
        Second Step: Using an assumption and other facts show that it is a contraposition
