#WEEK 4

  ➤ **Mathematical Induction**
     
      - A means of proving a theorem by showing that if it is true of any particular case, it is true of the 
      
      next case in series, and then showing that it is indeed true in one particular case.
        
  
      - It is a form of direct proof, and it is done in two steps. The first step, known as the Basic Step, is 
      
      to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the 
      
      Inductive step,it is to prove that the given statement for any one natural number implies the given 
      
      statement for the next natural number.  
      
  ➤ **Summation**
  
      - Symbol: ∑
      
      - Is the addition of a sequence of numbers; the result is called the sum or the total. 
  
  ➤ **Recursive/Inductive**
  
      - An algorithm that solves a problem by reducing it to a simpler input.
      
      Steps:
      
      1.) Basic Step
       
          - Specify the value of a given as a function a "0" 
      
      2.) Recursive Step
      
          - Create a rule in finding its value at a certain integer from its values at smaller integers.
          
#WEEK 5

      2.) Show that the program terminates correctly

        1.) Assume tha p is TRUE
        
        2.) Substitute to the program {S}, showing that q is TRUE

  ➤ **Cardinality**
    
    • Is the total number of distinct elements.
    
    •  New Terminology:
        
        ✓ ℵ₀

    • Types:
      
       ✓ One-to-one function

          - no common co-domain
       
       ✓ Onto Function
       
         - each co-domain is assigned to a domain.
         
         - no co-domain is left without a partner.
